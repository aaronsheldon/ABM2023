# ABM2023
Pedagogical project for ABM 2023 practicum participants. This repository contains a small web-
application that demonstrates a basic model-view-controller architecture using off the shelf
language constructs in both NodeJS and ECMAScript. The project is intended to illustrate a
clean separation of concerns between data, presentation, and behavior.
* Data is handled by RESTful APIs written in NodeJS
* Presentation is handled by by HTML and CSS in the client
* Behavior is handle by ECMAScript in the client.
